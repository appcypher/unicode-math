### TODO
- Bundling and optimization with Webpack.
- Add browser support.
- Add Rust implementation.
- Conversion of Rust implementation to WebAssembly.


### UPCOMING
- UnicodeMath to HTML/CSS
- UnicodeMath to Tex
- UnicodeMath to JS
- UnicodeMath to SVG
- Tex (math mode) to UnicodeMath
- UnicodeMath VSCode (unicode autocomplete, UnicodeMath in MD preview)
