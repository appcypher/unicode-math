### ABOUT
This library converts UnicodeMath to styled HTML code. It also has utilities for converting UnicodeMath to LaTex and vice versa.


### LIMITATIONS
- Currently, this only supports UTF-8 encoded strings and it relies on JavaScript string iteration implementation for character separation. In the future, this library will implement its own string lexer to provide support for UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings.


### TODO
- Bundling and optimization with Webpack.
- Add browser support.
- Add Rust implementation.
- Conversion of Rust implementation to webassembly.
