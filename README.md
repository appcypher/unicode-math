### ABOUT
This library is a for rendering UnicodeMath. It also provides support for converting UnicodeMath to LaTex and vice versa.


### LIMITATIONS
- Currently, this only supports UTF-8 encoded strings and it relies on JavaScript string iteration implementation for character separation. In the future, this library will implement its own string lexer to provide support other UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, as well as proper mathematical character separation.


### TODO
- Bundling and optimization with Webpack.
- Add browser support.
